# About Me

Hello!

I am glad to meet you here.

I am from China. Currently, I am working in Singapore in the field of commodity market quantitative trading and analysis.

In my job, as a quantitative analyst, I have worked for several banks and traders in Singapore. I assist banks in building financial product pricing models and market risk control models. For traders, I focus on modelling and forecasting commodity supply and demand, as well as constructing quantitative trading strategies.

In life, I am a pursuer of efficiency and beauty. I am fond of new technologies and am willing to try new things.

I hope that my notes here can spark inspiration when combined with your wisdom! It would be my honour!

Best regards,
Haoyu
